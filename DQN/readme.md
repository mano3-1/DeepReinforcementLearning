# Details : 
DQN is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm which was a breakthrough by open AI. This section solely aims to implement the DQN for multiple games in pytorch.

DQN overcomes unstable learning by mainly 4 techniques. <\br>
  1.Experience Replay <\br>
  2.Target Network  <\br>
  3.Clipping Rewards <\br>
  4.Skipping Frames <\br>
